/*Artist's statement: //<>//

I decided I would be very motivated to create my game if it were to be inspired by a concept I cared and knew about a lot. Feminism is very important to me, so I chose to make a 
game that shows people how to become better feminists. This theme gave me ample ideas for things the improving feminist player could "reject" (i.e. republicans, mainsplainers, 
cat calling, etc., as well as self-deprecation, which every improving feminist should avoid). This theme also gave me many ideas for things the player could strive to have
(thus the "femme friends", "Bell Hooks", and "intersectional" feminist spheres). This dualism that arose in my feminist theme allowed me to develop a game in which two actions
are needed to win: dragging the oppressive cubes into feminist hell with a mouse, and using the arrows to make the avatar collide with feminist concepts (and avoid self-Deprecation!).
I think this dual action is creative, especially that these actions were coded with the fact that this game should be a cooperative game in mind. Indeed, feminism is a movement 
towards community building and anti-individualism, and I wanted my feminist game to reflect that. Therefore, two players work together to win!
Additionally, songs by Rihanna and Beyonc√© - feminist idols - play at the end of the game, making women feel warm and welcomed, whether they won or lost! 
A webcam at the end also shows the player how wonderful they are (I was careful not to say "beautiful", because women's worth is sadly mostly placed on their beauty). 
I was also careful to use language directed at women on the end screens, because women could use a space to feel specifically welcomed, as many spaces are unwelcoming to us.

I believe a specifically interesting coding technique I used was the coding for the movement of the boxes, spheres, and self-deprecating cubes.
It was difficult figuring out how to make them move in a flowing way with the noise function on the y axis without the speed of the cubes on the x axis influencing
the movement of the objects on the y axis. A totally separate array needed to be created to implement the noise. It was also hard figuring out how to make elements of arrays
disappear, as we had not really looked at this much in the exercises nor in class. A floatList was what was necessary to remove elements from the arrays.

I designed my work on the programming knowledge I gained over the course almost exclusively. I used the exercises we did in class as well as the 
midterm "Pong" as models. Thanks to the class and these coded examples, I was able to use classes, arrays, sound, the webcam, an internal timer for 
the game, 3D rendering, how to change fonts, how to make objects collide, how to implement functions like keyPressed() and mouseDragged(), and more. 
I tried to take something we learned from every week and implement it into my game.

I hope you enjoy learning to be a better feminist!

/*Game: Becoming a better feminist!
the point is to make 19 points in less then 1 minute
the player can make points by 1)dragging the boxes (which are negative for someone's feminist growth)
into feminist hell and 2) by moving the avatr and making it collide with the spheres.
One point is made for each box dragged into feminist hell, and one point is made each time the avatar collides with a sphere */
